        <h3>The Beginning - San Carlos, CA </h3>
        <p> I was born and raised in San Carlos, California by my mother, an educator and my father, a tech company executive. They instilled me with values of inclusion, academic excellence and doing good for people and the planet.

        <h3>High School: 2010 to 2014 - Redwood City, CA</h3>
        <p> From 2010 to 2014 I attended Sequoia High School in Redwood City, California. I was a club swimmer, and also swam and played water polo for my high school. I was a member of the California Scholarship Federation and an All-American Athlete for both swimming and water polo.</p>

        <h3>College: 2014 to 2018 - Carlisle, PA </h3>
        <p>In August of 2014 I moved thousands of miles away from home to Carlisle, Pennsylvania to continue my education at Dickinson College. In my second semester at Dickinson I was invited to join and initiated into Kappa Alpha Theta, a Women’s Fraternity with values of intellectual curiosity, leadership potential, commitment to service, and personal excellence. During my sophomore year, I joined the Red Devil Swim Club, Dickinson’s club swim team and was made co-president. I was also the club’s representative on the Sports Club Council. <br><br>

        <h3>Summer Abroad: 2016 - Málaga, Spain </h3>

        <h3>Summer: 2016 - San Francisco, CA </h3>
        <p>After returning home to California from Málaga, I interned for Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) in San Francisco. At E2 I helped in advocating for California environmental policy through data input, policy briefs and meeting with California state senators in support of CA Senate Bill 32, which expands on the 2006 Assembly Bill 32 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In September 2016 the bill passed!</p>

        <h3>Semester Abroad: 2017 - Málaga, Spain </h3>
        <p>In Spring 2017, I was able to return to Málaga for a semester abroad. I spent 5 months living with a Spanish host family and attending classes at the Universidad de Málaga. By the end of my stay in Spain, my Spanish fluency had improved immensely along with my understanding of Spanish culture.</p>

        <h3>Summer: 2017 - Harrisburg, PA </h3>
        <p>In the summer before my senior year at Dickinson, I was able to have two different internships.

There, I managed various case files and attended court hearings where CASA and Children and Youth Services were involved while also learning first-hand the challenges children in our communities face every day.</p>
